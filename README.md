# Lito

<img align=right height=125 src=.github/f5a3d8aa3d1ee5333c23b0416c7e52ca.png>

Lito is just a bot that still is being worked on since 2019. This is a small project that I made.

Lito has no many commands so there won't be much things to look in this github repo.
The current commands for Lito (those who are curious) is:
  - dadjoke:      `Says a dad joke. 2 second cooldown.`
  - feedback:     `A command that sends feedback to the owner. 150 second cooldown.`
  - guildinfo:    `Shows information about the server. 5 second cooldown.`
  - hownonce:     `How much of an nonce he is? 2 second cooldown with 4 tries.`
  - random:       `Chooses a random user. 5 second cooldown.`
  - userinfo:     `Shows information about the user. 5 second cooldown.`
  - stats/info: `Shows the stats about the bot. 5 second cooldown.`
  - source: `Sends the source link to Lito.`
  - dong: `yes. 2 second cooldown with 4 tries.`
